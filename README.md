## Introduction.
They say that education without implementation is entertainment. After learning Tailwind CSS, I decided to put what have lerned into practice by building this small awesome project, just to make sure I wasnt entertaining myself learning Tailwind CSS. You can view the live demo of the project [here](https://my-tailwind-css-project.netlify.app/)

## Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind CSS is one of the most used CSS framework. It makes it quicker to write and maintain code of your application. In this project. I decided to give it a try, and I cant deny the fact that have fallen in love with it. Its one of the easiest framework to learn. Tailwind CSS is a CSS liblary. So if you are planning to start learning Tailwind css, I would advice that you first have a strong understanding of Vanilla CSS. 

Tailwind CSS has one main advantage, by using this utility-first framework, you don't have to write custom CSS to style your application. Instead, you can use utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of your application. This means that you dont have to write alot of CSS to style you application. Tailwind CSS will make your work as a Front-end developer very easy 

If you are planning to learn Tailwind CSS, you can read [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/). Once you are done, you can test your skills, just as I did.
